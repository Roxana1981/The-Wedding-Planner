## Testing

**Functional**

-  Navigation bar was tested to ensure that Home, Gallery and Contact Us links work for users to access every page of the website.  Homepage can also be accessed through a click to **The Wedding Planner** logo. 
-  Sound bar available in the main image of the homepage tested.
-  Social media links in the footer were tested in the three pages of the website to ensure that they correctly open in a new browser window.

**Responsive user experience**

-  Tested the responsive design with break points of: 1200px, 1024px, 740px and 320px using Chrome dev tool.

-  Testing was completed on the following devices: desktop, laptop, Ipad Mini and Samsung A51.

-  Home page required various styling adjustments of navigation bar, main image and main content for the above break points.  

-  Gallery page of the website has the best responsive design in all devices.

-  Contact Us page required a level of adjustments for some of the break points to ensure correct ratio of the contact form and background image on screens.

Although updates were performed after testing of the responsive design, there are still additional changes possible in order to improve the overall user experience.

**Bugs**

*Fixed:*

-  Througout the responsive design development and testing, there were a number of bugs identified which were subsequently resolved through adjustment in CSS styling.

*Unfixed:*

-  It was identified that in Ipad Mini, the audio control in the main image does not allow the user to unmute.  Therefore, the music can not be listed to.

-  At certain resolutions, the navigation bar links may move on the top of each other incorrectly.
